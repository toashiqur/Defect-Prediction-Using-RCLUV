The replication package: **Defect Prediction Using RCLUV.7z** contains the bug datasets needed to replicate our study. It also has the RCLUV extractor for Java. The datasets were built from two existing benchmark bug datasets: the [Eclipse bug dataset][eclipse-link] and the [GitHub bug database][githubbug-link].

The thesis is available for download from [qthesis][thesis-link]

      <dd>It has eight files. Fore each particular classifier the *.all_models_avg.xlsx files contain the 10 fold cross validation results of 10 randomly undersampled subsets of the datasets. Compare_with_Toth.xlsx compares the performance of RCLUV-based models with product metrics-based models. Voting_performance.xlsx gives the performance of majority voting classifiers for each project. Individual vs Voting performance.xlsx compares the performance obtained using a single classifier and a voting classifier for each project.

# Replication of the Study
In our [report][thesis-link] we published the performance of the models developed using the [WEKA][weka-link] machine learning tool. We used WEKA version 3.8. The \*.arff data files provided in *Eclipse\Eclipse_filename_bug_RCLUV\\* and *GitHub\GitHub_filename_bug_RCLUV\\* can be used to train machine learning models in WEKA with the minimum effort.

## Hyperparameters
  Below we present the hyperparameters that were used to develop the models.

# Running the RCLUV Extractor
The RCLUV extractor is written in [TXL][txl-link]. You need to have it installed on your machine.

## Feature Extraction
The *RCLUVExtractor* directory contains a script **AnalyzeRCLUV.sh**. It takes a java directory name as its argument, and finds all the \*.java files from the given directory. After extracting the RCLUVs of the source files it generates a \*.RCLUVAnalysis.csv in the parent directory of the give project directory. The extractor writes any errors or warnings triggered during the feature extraction process to the result file. The AnalyzeRCLUV.sh script should be invoked using the following command.

```
./AnalyzeRCLUV.sh Java_directory
```
Below we use the above command on the source files of *examples/java* directory provided with the RCLUVExtractor.
```
rahman@MSI-GP62-6QF:~/Downloads/RCLUVExtractor$ ./AnalyzeRCLUV.sh examples/java
Compiling 
.....................................................................................Done.
```
It generates a java.RcluvAnalysis.csv file inside the directory *examples/*

## Feature Titles
The titles of the feature columns aree needed to be generated separately using the following command.
```
txl -q -s 1000 dummy.java rcluv-java.txl -d SPREADSHEET -d TITLES 2> titles
```
We run the above command replacing the *dummy.java* placeholder with the path of a java file as shown below.
```
rahman@MSI-GP62-6QF:~/Downloads/RCLUVExtractor$ txl -q -s 1000 examples/java/Policy.java rcluv-java.txl -d SPREADSHEET -d TITLES 2> titles.txt
```
It generates a titles.txt file inside the *RCLUVExtractor* directory.
