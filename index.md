Compare_with_Toth.xlsx compares the performance of RCLUV-based models with product metrics-based models. Voting_performance.xlsx give the voting performance of the models. Individual vs Voting performance.xlsx compares the performance obtained using a single classifier and a voted classifier for each project.

# Replication of the Study
To make the performance of the developed models comparable with existing research we used the [WEKA][weka-link] machine learning tool. The models were developed using WEKA version 3.8. The \*.arff data files provided in *Eclipse\Eclipse_filename_bug_RCLUV\\* and *GitHub\GitHub_filename_bug_RCLUV\\* can be used to train machine learning models in WEKA with the minimum effort.

## Hyperparameters
  Below we present the hyperparameters that were used to develop the models.

# Running the RCLUV Extractor
## Feature Extraction
The *RCLUVExtractor* directory contains a file **AnalyzeRCLUV.sh**. It takes a java directory name as its argument, and finds all the \*.java files from the given directory. After extracting the RCLUVs of the source files it generates a \*.RCLUVAnalysis.csv in the parent directory of the give project directory.

```
./AnalyzeRCLUV.sh Java_directory
```
Below we use the above command on the source files of *examples/java* directory provided with the RCLUVExtractor.
```
rahman@MSI-GP62-6QF:~/Downloads/RCLUVExtractor$ ./AnalyzeRCLUV.sh examples/java
Compiling 
.....................................................................................Done.
```
It generates a java.RcluvAnalysis.csv file inside the *examples/* directory

## Feature Titles
The titles of the feature columns aree needed to be generated separately using the following command.
```
txl -q -s 1000 dummy.java rcluv-java.txl -d SPREADSHEET -d TITLES 2> titles
```
We run the above command replacing the *dummy.java* placeholder with the path of a java file as shown below.
```
rahman@MSI-GP62-6QF:~/Downloads/RCLUVExtractor$ txl -q -s 1000 examples/java/Policy.java rcluv-java.txl -d SPREADSHEET -d TITLES 2> titles.txt
```
It generates a titles.txt file inside the *RCLUVExtractor* directory.
