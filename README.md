This research was done under the supervision of Dr. James R. Cordy, School of Computing, Queen's University, Kingston.

## Replication
The replication package: Defect Prediction Using RCLUV.7z contains the bug datasets needed to replicate our study. It also has the RCLUV extractor for Java. Please see https://toashiqur.github.io/Defect-Prediction-Using-RCLUV/ for more details. The datasets were built from two existing benchmark bug datasets: the Eclipse bug dataset (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4273265) and the GitHub bug database (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-42089-9_44).
