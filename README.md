## Replication
The replication package: Defect Prediction Using RCLUV contains the bug datasets needed to replicate our study.
The datasets were built from two existing benchmark bug datasets: the Eclipse bug dataset (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4273265) and the GitHub bug database(https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-42089-9_44)
