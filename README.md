## Replication
The replication package: Defect Prediction Using RCLUV.7z contains the bug datasets needed to replicate our study. It also has the RCLUV extractor for Java. The datasets were built from two existing benchmark bug datasets: the Eclipse bug dataset (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4273265) and the GitHub bug database (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-42089-9_44).
