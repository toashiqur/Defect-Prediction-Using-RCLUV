This research was done under the supervision of Dr. James R. Cordy, School of Computing, Queen's University, Kingston.

## Replication
The replication package: Defect Prediction Using RCLUV.7z contains the bug datasets needed to replicate our study. It also has the RCLUV extractor for Java. Please see the ReadMe files in the replication package for more details. The datasets were built from two existing benchmark bug datasets: the Eclipse bug dataset (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4273265) and the GitHub bug database (https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-42089-9_44).
